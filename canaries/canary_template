Reasoning
----------

Existing and proposed laws, especially as relate to the US Patriot Act,
etc., provide for secret warrants, searches and seizures of data, such as
library records.

Some such laws provide for criminal penalties for revealing the warrant,
search or seizure, disallowing the disclosure of events that would
materially affect the users of a service such as those provided by
taskhive developers and subsidiary domains and services.

In the event of requests related to surveillance, backdoor, or compromising
the integrity of the signing keys of taskhive in any manner, this warrant
canary will cease to be published.

Additional red flags, such as removing existing canaries, closing repositories,
or not responding to direct inquiries regarding warrants, gag orders, and
other requests should be heeded and all usage of taskhive should cease.

Special note should be taken if the format of this canary changes considerably
without explanation and no longer includes definitive statements regarding
requests, or if the canary message ever ceases being updated, or any are
removed from this repo.


Statements
-----------

The taskhive core developers who have digitally signed this file [1]
state the following:

1. The date of issue of this canary is _____  __, ____.

2. The taskhive master signging fingerprint is:

    427F 11FD 0FAA 4B08 0123  F01C DDFA 1A3E 3687 9494

3. No warrants have ever been served to us with regard to the taskhive
project (e.g. to hand out the private signing keys or to introduce
backdoors).

4. We plan to publish the next of these canary statements in the first
two weeks of _____ ____. Special note should be taken if no new canary
is published by that time or if the list of statements changes without
plausible explanation.

Special announcements
----------------------

* We would like to remind you that taskhive has been designed under
the assumption that all relevant infrastructure is permanently
compromised.  This means that we assume NO trust in any of the servers
or services which host or provide any taskhive related data, in
particular, software updates, source code repositories, application
downloads, and data transport nodes.

Disclaimers and notes
----------------------

This canary scheme is not infallible. Although signing the declaration
makes it very difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary
declarations, it does not prevent them from using force or other
means, like blackmail or compromising the signers' laptops, to coerce
us to produce false declarations.

The news feeds quoted below (Proof of Freshness) serves to demonstrate
that this canary could not have been created prior to the date stated.
It shows that a series of canaries was not created in advance.

This declaration is merely a best effort and is provided without any
guarantee or warranty. It is not legally binding in any way to
anybody. None of the signers should be ever held legally responsible
for any of the statements made here.

Proof of freshness
-------------------

Footnotes
----------

[1] This file should be signed in two ways: (1) via detached PGP
signatures by each of the signers, distributed together with this
canary in the taskhive repo, and (2) via digital signatures
on the corresponding taskhive repo tags. [2]

[2] Don't just trust the contents of this file blindly! Verify the
digital signatures!
